* CHALLENGES
- implement OP_CONSTANT_LONG: because the operand to OP_CONSTANT is a single byte
(256) maximum constants are allowed, which may be too small. Howeverm to allow for
more constants, we create OP_CONSTANT_LONG whose operand is a 24 bit number.  (DONE)

- implement 'run-length-encoding'(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding)
to save space storing line number of byte_code and their operands.

- support string interpolation.
